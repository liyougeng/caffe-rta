# caffe-rta
Modified caffe distribution to provide real-time augmentation.  Based upon [@ChenlongChen](https://github.com/ChenglongChen)'s [caffe-windows](https://github.com/ChenglongChen/caffe-windows).

No additional functionality added, I just made the required changes to allow compilation on Linux.  Tested on Ubuntu 14.04.

## I am not maintaining or actively supporting this code.  It is made available as-is.  Thanks!
